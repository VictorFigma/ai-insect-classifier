# ðŸŒ¿ Insect Classification 

## ðŸ“¸ Context
This project was created as part of a job application challenge to showcase my skills. It utilizes a dataset that cannot be shared due to (potential) confidentiality reasons, and no PRs are allowed.

### ðŸ“Š Data Processing

"Data preprocessing should be applied to normalize or scale the continuous sensor variables."

## ðŸŽ¯ Tasks

"Your mission is to <u>**develop a model that classifies insects into their respective categories (0, 1, or 2) based on sensor readings**</u>. This task will involve analyzing sensor data like 'Sensor_alpha', 'Sensor_beta', and so on, to determine the category of the insect. The provided dataset has been pre-processed and split into training and testing sets for your convenience."
